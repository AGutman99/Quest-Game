Librarian: Hello and welcome to MiauzAcademy! I'm the school librarian and I'll help you to get through your first day of school. 
You: Hello! Thank you so much!
Librarian: Since this is your first day here, you have to get to know our houses. There are four different elements Fire, Water, Air and Earth. Each element represents a different specialization. 
You: That sounds intereseting...
Librarian: So your task for today is to decide in which house you want to go. Therefore you have to do different tasks.
You: Alright! Where do I start?
Librarian: At first, you have to go through the big gate... But the handle is lost. Maybe you can find it? Go search near the big cauldron because I couldn't find it here. 
You: Well... That sounds easy!
